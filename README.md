# matrix
Using OpenCV Python to create a filter on the screen

The code displays the user's video but only shows parts, filtering out light colours (typically background colours). The rest that is filtered out is replaced by an image of the matrix, so it appears as though the user is in the matrix.

This project uses OpenCV masking and combining video and an image to display an updated image.

Below is when I use the filter, it only shows my sweater, glasses, and some facial features.

Note: The matrix image was found online and does not belong to me.
